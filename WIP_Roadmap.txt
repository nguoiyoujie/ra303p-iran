Roadmap
-------------------------------------------

Code organization and documentation
1. Restructure code according to the following groups:
      - src/defines                Containing enums, class definitions, function addresses
	  - src/macros                 Containing common reusable code. This includes the macros for getters and setters of class elements
      - src/class_extensions       Expansion logic and preload sequences for various class definitions
      - src/fixes                  General fixes
      - src/features               New features

    Others to be determined as they are encountered

2. Code documentation
      - Every file should be documented with some kind of specification.
      - Ideally, one feature per file. If a function uses more than one feature, the function goes to the most critical/dominant of features, and the rest shall reference it.
