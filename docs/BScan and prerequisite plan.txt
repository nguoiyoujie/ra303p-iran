New Prerequisite design

Global change to BScan calculations

Instead of using the BuildingType.Type / ID index to indicate the BScan bitfield it represents, read a byte with customizable value.
0-31 are supported, and used for prerequisite checks. The Remastered code appears to use 64-bit long for BScan and related variables, but the game code appears to use 32-bits

Because of the universal use of BScan, there will be some impact on trackers and trigger events that depend on them.
This include the Building Exists event, which acts as a prerequisite check. This was why the event trigger does not work beyond the 32nd building. The Building Exists event shall be modified so they do a proper count of the building.
This also includes the Fakes Destroyed event, which does not work anyway because the Fakes are the 32nd building onwards. Nice one, Westwood.

The tradeoff, of course, is the loss of checks against individual structure types, unlike RA2 where you can check against both groups and individual types. We will need to design a new structure for that.
