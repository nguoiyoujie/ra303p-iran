-------

Unsorted features from previous patches are kept here.

<details><summary>Unsorted Features</a></summary><samp>

31.  The game will now tell you if you're hosting Aftermath or not when you have the aftermath
     expansion enabled. If someone without Aftermath joins your online Aftermath game (effectively
     changing your game into a non-Aftermath game) text will appear making it clear Aftermath is
     turned "off". This doesn't apply to joining games, as the needed info is only send once the
     game is started by the host, sadly..

61.  The game now is forced to run under single CPU affinity set, this is to prevent freezing and
     random crashes on certain CPUs.

62.  Fixed movies and audio lag on certain processors when single CPU affinity is enabled.

63.  Fixed ToInherit= map keyword, this keyword will no longer be read in non-single player games.



74.  Fixed the automatic sonar pulse (submarine decloak) when a team doesn't have any non-submarines
     left. This logic was applied to singleplayer too which broke a few missions and added weird
     behavior on some. The logic is now multiplayer only. (Thanks to Arda.dll.inj by AlexB for
     showing me where to patch this)



82.  Added a fix for the cnc-ddraw bug where the mouse randomly disappears.

106. The game has been patched so the single player score screen will decide whether a house is
     Soviet or Allies by checking what country the house plays as, instead of by the house
     itself. The game needs to decide this to calculate buildings destroyed and casualties for a
     side. With the added ability to change what country a house plays at (say USSR can play as
     France) this is needed.

107. When playing as a country higher than the internal number of 9 (e.g. plying as "Special") the
     game would crash because sidebar graphics couldn't be loaded. The Allies sidebar is loaded
     now. This affects the following countries: Neutral, Special and Multi1-8. Note that these
     "countries" are different from houses. In multiplayer your house is either multi1 to multi8 and
     the country you play as is USSR, Greece etc.

108. The GNRL unit (Volkov for Soviets, Stavros for Allies) had Stavros' voice when playing as
     Ukraine. For no clear reason. He has the generic Soviet voice now, like he has when playing as
     USSR or BadGuy.


119. Added code by hifi to make the in-game "Internet" button launch the CnCNet.org site. You can
     disable this by adding "EnableWOL=yes" under the "[Options]" section in REDALERT.INI, it will
     then run the normal 3.03 code for Westwood Online.

120. Fixed an issue where the sidebar will very rarely show multiple units being built at the same
     completion stage in the sidebar while only one unit was being built. NOTE that there still
     might be at least one other glitched sidebar bug out there. Bug reported and reproduced in a
     savegame by Ehy.


122. Added support for a DOS interface mod. This will make the interface look like the DOS one, the
     sidebar, cameo icons, radar graphics and tabs all look like they do in the DOS version of the
     game. The game's menu hasn't been changed though. The REDALERT.INI option UseDOSInterfaceMod=
     (yes/no) under the [Options] section controls loading DOSINTERFACEMOD.MIX, which contain the
     graphics.

     There's another keyword under the same section of the INI file; ColorRemapSidebarIcons=
     (yes/no) to make the DOS interface cameo icons use the remap color of the color the player is
     playing as to change the color of parts of the cameo icon that would normally be yellow.



127. Added a code change that should fix the rare crash when building a Radar Dome.

128. Lowered the time out wait period for online games to 30 seconds both at the start of the game
     and midway through the game. The old wait period for the start of the game was 120 seconds and
     the old wait period for midway through the game was 180 seconds.

129. Made clicking the "Serial/Modem" button (to open the menu for modem games) do nothing, as the
     modem menus weren't adjusted for the high resolution patch. This made them appear incorrectly
     on higher resolutions. The button has been disabled as no one uses modem anymore.

130. Some audio related error message message boxes had "Command & Conquer" as their title. This has
     been fixed and their title is now "Red Alert", like the other error messsage boxes.

131. When selecting an ore patch in the radar minimap with an Ore Truck selected the cursor would
     turn into a "Can't move there" cursor instead of an "Attack" cursor. This has been fixed.



135. Added a minor change so aircrafts will only show the amount of maximum ammo they can carry
     instead of always showing 5. For example the MIG has a max ammo count of 3 but would always
     show 5 pips. Fix taken from Arda by AlexB.

136. Fixed selling vehicles on Service depot so you can sell them without having them first be
     repaired by the Service Depot.


138. Added new IsCoopMode= option to the [Basic] section of a map, this enabled some single player
     logic like single player AI logic and allows you to make coop maps with working AI
     production/teamtypes/auto-create/triggers etc and working win/lose triggers. Additional
     documentation forthcoming.

139. Added the option ForceSingleCPU=(Yes/No) to the [Options] section of REDALERT.INI. This forces
     single CPU affinity like cnc-ddraw does. This might be needed if you experience crashes or
     freezes.

140. You can now configure the gem and ore values for Ore Truck dumping for AI players and at
     various difficulty settings. This overwrites the GemValue= and OreValue= RULES.INI
     settings. The new added keywords are:

     ```ini
     [AI]
     ; Easy/Normal/Hard here refers to the handicap set on
     ; the AI player, handicap 'easy' makes thing easier for
     ; the AI player and he is harder to beat than with 'hard'
     ; handicap
     EasyAIGoldValue=300
     EasyAIGemValue=350
     NormalAIGoldValue=200
     NormalAIGemValue=250
     HardAIGoldValue=50
     HardAIGemValue=150
     ```

     If a keyword is missing -1 is used as value. If -1 is used as value the game uses the RULES.INI
     GemValue= setting for gems and OreValue= for ore. These keywords work in anything that
     functions as a RULES.INI kind of file, e.g. map files. So you can use these values in a map
     mod.

141. Added ReenableAITechUpCheck=(Yes/No) under the [AI] section of files that act like RULES.INI
     files (e.g. RULES.INI, AFTMATH.INI and map files). This re-enables the check the game does
     before allowing the AI to build a Radar Dome. This option has been added as this patch breaks
     some special (coop) maps which rely on this logic.

142. Added fixes for two naval exploits: repairing on the move and repairing on enemy naval
     yards. These fixes are applied by default in single player and skirmish and during spawner
     games. (Fix taken from AlexB's Arda, many thanks for also explaining the fix)

143. Messages typed by yourself ingame are now displayed just like messages from other players.
    
147.	It's now possible to use BuildingTypes in TeamTypes/taskforces. So you can for example now have buildings paradropped in.
